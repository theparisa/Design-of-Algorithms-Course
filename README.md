# Design-of-Algorithms-Course


This course teaches core strategies for designing efficient algorithms, such as breaking problems down recursively and building up solutions from simpler subproblems. These methods are applied to find optimal solutions for challenges involving graphs and networks, like determining the best routes or maximum capacity. The course also provides a theoretical framework for understanding computational limits, helping to identify which problems are solvable in a practical amount of time.
